# draft-moskowitz-eddsa-pki

The IETF has adopted the Edwards Elliptic Curve and related algorithms. These
algorithms hold out the promise of greater efficiency and better understood
security risks.

This efficiency could make that critical difference to allow them to be used
in some constrained IoT devices.

This working document demonstrates building a three-tier PKI using EdDSA keys
using OpenSSL.
